# AutoKill
A simple windows app that can kill selected processes.

HELP -- To get the program up and running you can download the repository and find the .exe file.
It is in \bin\Debug\AutoKill.

Double click it and the program should open.

Once you have it up and running check the boxes next to tasks that you want to kill. None of the tasks are necessary for your computer to run.

FUTURE UPDATES -- If you want to see more features feel free to request them. I made the program specifically to shut down Chrome because Chrome slows my computer down. I'd be happy to keep adding stuff though.
